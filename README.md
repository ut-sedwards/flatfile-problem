# Getting Started

Before you begin, set up your environment variables. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your credentials.

Your `.env` file should look similar to this:

```
FLATFILE_API_KEY="[LOCAL DEVELOPMENT KEY]"
FLATFILE_ENVIRONMENT_ID="[LOCAL ENVIRONMENT KEY]"
```

The pre-set credentials are pointing to a development only environment and can be used as needed for local development and hosted testing.

## Development

To run the project and develop locally run `yarn dev` to start a local listener.
